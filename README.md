+# Generative DRL EIS Recovery
+
+This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and accompanying data for exploring generative deep reinforcement learning approaches to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) state recovery.
+
+## Repository Structure
+
+- `data/` – Excel files with EIS state data (`EIS_state_1.xlsx`–`EIS_state_5.xlsx`).
+- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for analysis, including `generative_DRL_EIS_Recovery.ipynb`.
+
+## Usage
+
+1. Install the necessary Python packages (e.g., NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, etc.).
+2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
+   ```bash
+   jupyter notebook
+   ```
+3. Open `notebooks/generative_DRL_EIS_Recovery.ipynb` to explore the analysis.
+
+Feel free to contribute improvements or report issues.
