# Generative DRL EIS Recovery

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and accompanying data for exploring generative deep reinforcement learning approaches to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) state recovery.

## Repository Structure

- `data/` – Excel files with EIS state data (`EIS_state_1.xlsx`–`EIS_state_5.xlsx`).
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for analysis, including `generative_DRL_EIS_Recovery.ipynb`.

## Usage

1. Install the necessary Python packages (e.g., NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, etc.).
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `notebooks/generative_DRL_EIS_Recovery.ipynb` to explore the analysis.

Feel free to contribute improvements or report issues.
